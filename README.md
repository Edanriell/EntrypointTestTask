# EntrypointTestTask

This repository contains my implementation of the **Entrypoint Test Task**, which I extended far beyond the initial requirements defined in [`taskEn.md`](./taskEn.md).  
The project demonstrates a **production-grade, full-stack e-commerce solution** with a strong focus on **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design**, and **modern frontend patterns**.

---

## Overview

This project is a **full-stack e-commerce management system** consisting of two parts:

- **Server** — built with **.NET** (Clean Architecture, CQRS, Dapper, PostgreSQL, Docker, Keycloak)  
- **Client** — built with **Next.js**, **TanStack Query**, and **Feature-Sliced Design**

The system allows managing **Orders**, **Products**, **Payments**, **Refunds**, and **Users**, with rich domain logic and a clean separation of concerns between layers.

## Backend Highlights

- **Clean Architecture & CQRS** for maintainability and scalability  
- **Rich Domain Models** enforcing business rules and invariants  
- **PostgreSQL + Dapper** for efficient data access  
- **Dockerized environment** for consistent deployment  
- **Keycloak integration** for authentication and authorization  

---

## Frontend Highlights

- **Next.js** (App Router) with **Feature-Sliced Design**  
- **TanStack Query** for server-state management  
- **NextAuth.js** for authentication flow  
- **ShadCN/UI**, **Recharts**, and **Framer Motion** for elegant, animated UI  
- Full integration with backend CQRS endpoints
